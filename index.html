            Democracy Index Continues to Decline in 2021
        </h2>
        <p style='text-align: left'>
            The Economist's "Democracy Index", which is released on an annual basis, reveals yet another year of declining democratic norms.
        </p>
        <p style='text-align: left'>
            The average global score fell from last year's 5.37 to a new low of 5.28 out of ten. Much of the decline can be attributed to pandemic restrictions, which have brought with it a decline in civil liberties and freedom of movement.

            Balancing freedom with safety continues to be at the forefront of the debate over pandemic policies, particularly as China's draconian pandemic restrictions have increasingly been in the news. 
        </p>
        <p style='text-align: left; margin-bottom: 4%'>
            While pandemic restrictions were the primary reason for the decline in western democracies, Latin America saw the largest decline across the board due to contested and/or flawed elections in countries such as Peru, Nicaragua, and Chile.
